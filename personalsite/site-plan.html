        Hello, and welcome to my webpage! If you want to get to know who I even am, the About Me (TODO: Link page) page has anything you need to know. Alternativily, you may view
        any of the particularly cool things (though there is not much there...) at the Showroom (TODO: Link page) page!

      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <h4>Introduction</h4>
      <p> 
        My name is Peter Smart. I am the youngest in my family, out of three boys. I am not particularly interesting, and am quite unskilled at social interaction, though I do try
        my best.
        </p>
        <h4>Important Links and Contact Information</h4>
          <p>https://github.com/petersmart214</p>
          <p>
            Personal Email:
            peter.kent.smart@gmail.com
          (TODO: add other contacts / links)
        </p>
        
          <h4>Skills</h4>
        <p>
        I am an amateur programmer. (one day I may be able to be called a software engineer!) The languages I know are Java, a decent grasp of Python, Javascript, and Lua, and I am
        learning C#. Beyond the realm of languages I have learned much about the inner workings of computers, and recently have taught myself the basics of networking (basics is an
        overstatement, though)
        </p>
        <p>There is not much I am skilled at beyond computers, but one thing I am decent at is teaching myself complicated things!</p>
        
        <h4>Interests</h4>
        <p>
          As an avid fan of all things computer, most of my interests are related to anything electronic. Video games, programming, and a smidgen of electrical engineering are among
        my favorites! Some of the games I like include Factorio, From The Depths, Rain World, Portal 2, and Starbound. Outside of video games, I also enjoy hard science fiction,
        though the hardness thereof is up for debate... Those that revolve around the idea of AI and manufactured beings are my absolute favorites.

      <h3>Showroom</h3>
      <p>
        (TODO: actually do something interesting enough to show-off)
        Moooooooost of the interesting things Ive done are in video games.... Yeah.
        I am terrible at finishing anything actually real, (or difficult) though I like to start lots of stuff! I tried my hand at modding minecraft once, though abandoned it pretty quickly.
        I did make a super getto windmill generator once, out of some wooden planks and an old DC motor, certainly the coolest thing I've done.
