        <h3>About Me</h3>
      <h4>Introduction</h4>
      <p> 
        My name is Peter Smart. I am the youngest in my family, out of three boys. I am not particularly interesting, and am quite unskilled at social interaction, though I do try
        my best.

            <h4>Skills</h4>
            <p>
            I am an amateur programmer. (one day I may be able to be called a software engineer!) The languages I know are Java, a decent grasp of Python, Javascript, and Lua, and I am
            learning C#. Beyond the realm of languages I have learned much about the inner workings of computers, and recently have taught myself the basics of networking (basics is an
            overstatement, though)
            </p>
            <p>There is not much I am skilled at beyond computers, but one thing I am decent at is teaching myself complicated things!</p>
            
            <h4>Interests</h4>
            <p>
            As an avid fan of all things computer, most of my interests are related to anything electronic. Video games, programming, and a smidgen of electrical engineering are among
            my favorites! Some of the games I like include Factorio, From The Depths, Rain World, Portal 2, and Starbound. Outside of video games, I also enjoy hard science fiction,
            though the hardness thereof is up for debate... Those that revolve around the idea of AI and manufactured beings are my absolute favorites.
